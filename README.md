# Hi! 👋 I'm Himanshu

<!-- A brief introduction with a bit of humor -->
I'm a self-proclaimed coding ninja in training at [IIITDM Kurnool, AP](https://www.example.com). I'm here to break the ice, not the code! Here's a little about me, with a sprinkle of humor:

## About Me 🧑‍💻

- 🌐 Computer Science and Engineering student
- 💡 Passionate about programming and tech (unless it's a Monday morning bug)
- 😄 Love sharing programming jokes (I promise, they're not as buggy as my code)
- 🎸 Music lover (my code has rhythm too, just a bit offbeat)
