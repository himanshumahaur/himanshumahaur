      I'm a self-proclaimed coding ninja in training at IIITDM Kurnool, AP. Breaking the ice, not the code! 😄
      <br>
      <br>
        - 🌐 Computer Science and Engineering student<br>
        - 💡 Passionate about programming and tech (unless it's a Monday morning bug)<br>
        - 😄 Love sharing programming jokes (I promise, they're not as buggy as my code)<br>
        - 🎸 Music lover (my code has rhythm too, just a bit offbeat)<br>
